//We're in a job interview. Answer the following questions (try to not look at your notes unless you have to).
  // 1) What is the purpose of the 'this keyword'?

      //Answer: To represent and reference the context of the invoked function. 

  // 2) What are the four rules that govern what the 'this keyword' is bound to and describe each?

      //Answer: 1. It is bound to the window object if the context is not defined.
      //        2. Object preceding dot is what "this" references
      //        3. If constructor is used, this refers to what constructor returns
      //        4. Call, apply, and bind are explicit

  // 3) What is the difference between call and apply?

      //Answer: call has more than just two arguments wheras apply has an array argument that would contain all extra arguments

  // 4) What does .bind do?

      //Answer: bind establishes the context of this forever. 


//Next Problem

//Create an object called user which has the following properties.
  //username --> which is a string
  //email --> which is a string
  //getUsername --> which is a function that returns the current object's username property. *Don't use 'user' instead use the 'this' keyword*

    //Code Here
    var user = {
      username: "willubyu7",
      email: "willubyu7@gmail.com",
      getUsername: function() {
        return this.username;
      }
    }

//Now, invoke the getUsername method and verify you got the username of the object and not anything else.
user.getUsername(user);


//Next Problem


// Write the function definitions which will make the following function invocations function properly.

  //Function Invocations Here
  function Car(mk,md,yr) {
    this.make = mk;
    this.model = md;
    this.year = yr;
    this.move = 0;
    this.moveCar = function() {
      this.move++;
      return this.move;
    }
  }

var prius = new Car('Toyota', 'Prius', 2011);
var mustang = new Car('Ford', 'Mustang', 2013);

prius.moveCar(); //increments prius' move property by 10. Returns the new move property.
mustang.moveCar(); //increments mustang' move property by 10. Returns the new move property.

//Hint, you'll need to add a move property and write a moveCar function which is added to every object that is being returned from the Car function. 
//You'll also need to use the 'this' keyword properly in order to make sure you're invoking moveCar on the right object (prius vs mustang).



//Continuation of previous problem

var getYear = function(){
  return this.year;
};

//Above you're given the getYear function. Using your prius and mustang objects from above, use the proper syntax that will allow for 
//you to call the getYear function with the prius then the mustang objects being the focal objects. *Don't add getYear as a property on both objects*.

//Note(no tests)
  //Code Here
  var getPriusYear = getYear.bind(prius);
  var getMustangYear = getYear.bind(mustang);

//New Problem

var myUser = {
 username: 'iliketurtles',
 age: 13,
 email: 'iliketurtles@gmail.com'
};

var getMyUsername = function() {
 return this.username;
};

var userName = getMyUsername.call(myUser); //Fix this

//Above you're given an object, and  a function. What will the getUsername function return?
//Note(no tests)
  //Answer: undefined

//In the example above, what is the 'this keyword' bound to when getUsername runs?

  //Answer: the window

//Fix the getMyUsername invocation so that userName will be equal to 'iliketurtles'.
